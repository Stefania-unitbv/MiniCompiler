# MiniCompiler
A C# compiler implementation for MiniLang, a C-like language with lexical, syntax, and semantic analysis capabilities.

MiniLang Compiler Implementation: A streamlined compiler for MiniLang, a programming language with C-like syntax, covering the full compilation process from lexical analysis to semantic analysis.

Features: Performs lexical scanning, syntax parsing, and semantic checks; Utilizes formal grammar for accurate parsing; Error reporting throughout compilation stages; Manages variables, functions, and structures with strong typing enforcement; Supports basic data types like int, float, double, string, and void; Handles global and local variable declarations, function definitions, and structures; Implements control structures such as if-else, while, and for loops; Validates function calls and parameters.
Technical Details: Developed in C# with ANTLR4 for parsing.
Outputs detailed files for tokens, variables, functions, and errors, ideal for educational use or further development.
